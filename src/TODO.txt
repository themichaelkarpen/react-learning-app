Set up API Services like this:
└── services
    └── UserService
        └── UserService.js

Infrastructure:
- Finish theme
- Modals
- Read/Write/Delete data
- Example how to use code on page and target and then put into a code block for tutorial
- Think about nav like projects/samples: books, recipes, jokes, etc

- Figure out Props / Prev Props using Hooks

- APIs for Books, Recipes or Jokes
- Modal to Open Details and also Save to File (as Favorite, etc)
- create feature on Modal to Favorite a movie - store in json file but create APIs for reading/writing/etc

- create better Design & CSS: Try Material UI
- create better loader
- use Transitions

- check out React Spring

- create global toastr alert for errors, success, etc - using Context, that any component or view can use
